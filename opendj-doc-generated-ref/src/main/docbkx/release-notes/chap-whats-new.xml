     <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Issue #201504-01:
       Proxied Authorization may allow unexpected escalation
       of privileges and access.</emphasis>
      When someone has been granted the privileges to Proxy requests
      and use the Proxied Authorization control,
      it is not possible to control who that user can impersonate.
      It is thus possible to impersonate "cn=Directory Manager"
      and bypass all access controls.
